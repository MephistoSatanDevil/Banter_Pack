# Banter Packs
Adds Banters to the BioWare NPCs of Baldur's Gate II! 
The Mod is compatible with all Baldur's Gate II games (BGII, BGT, BGII:EE, EET).

It's no secret that one of the most popular, enduring elements of Baldur's Gate 2 is the inter-party dialogue, or "banter", that crops up from
time to time, making the characters and gameworld seem more alive.

While some NPC mods have added significant quantities of banter to the game, by and large those banters have centered on the new NPC to some degree. But there are still plenty of stories to tell and episodes to show between the original "Bioware 17", the NPCs that shipped with the original game. The Banter Packs seek to breathe new life into those old companions with new dialogue sessions.
